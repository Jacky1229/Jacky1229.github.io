**Abstract:** This paper presents a hybrid precoding processor for millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems. The proposed architecture supports 64 antennas with 4-to-8 RF chains, and 4-bit phase resolution for each phase shifter in the analog beamformer. A polar decomposition (PD) engine is designed to achieve a 2.4-to-8.6× lower latency with 1.5-to-1.7× less normalized gate count compared to the singular value decomposition (SVD)-based implementation for the same functionality. Multiplicands are combined to reduce 55% area by utilizing the distributive property. Approximate phase extraction and low-precision multiplication for quantized phase extraction are adopted, which leads to 43% and 41% area reductions, respectively. The proposed hybrid precoding processor is designed in a 40-nm CMOS technology. It delivers a throughput of up to 10,288 kMat/s and consumes 170.9 mW at 278 MHz. It outperforms the state-of-the-art hybrid precoding processors with 5.5-13.7× higher normalized area efficiency and 6.9-38.4× lower normalized energy.
